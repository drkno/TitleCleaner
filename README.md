TitleCleaner
============

Cleans and renames the titles of downloaded media files (tv/movies).
Also incorporates functionality to retrieve missing TV Show titles from the TVDB as well as relocate files to appropriate storage locations (eg rename and move from a downloads folder to some media directory).

If there is insufficient information the program will make a best effort approach when trying to find names.

This is an improved version of the original mess located here:
